To clarify, 90% of this is **NOT** my own work, credits belong to Shadee Merhi and his tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/@shadmerhi

This was a tutorial I followed for the purpose of learning how to build a full stack web application from scratch using certain technologies. I used his tutorial to combine his knowledge and practice building my own certain features to learn.
